Petrifying touch: Anyone touched by a basilisk is turned to stone (save vs petrify). Petrifying gaze: Anyone meeting a basilisk’s gaze is turned to stone (save versus petrify). Unless averting eyes orusing a mirror, characters in melee are affected each round. Averting eyes: –4 penalty to-hit; the basilisk gains a +2 bonus to attack.
