May also be drawn to light or unusual smells.","extras":"Type and locomotion: A swarm may be composed of creepers (e.g. spiders, ants, centipedes) or flyers (e.g. bees, hornets). Some swarms are capable of both types of movement (e.g. beetles, locusts).\tSize: 10’ × 30’ area, typically.\tImmunity: Only harmed by fire, extreme cold, sleep spells (affect the whole swarm), smoke (drives off), or other attacks as the referee wishes.\tSwarm attack: Automatically damages characters within swarm area: 2hp if wearing armour, 4hp without.\tWarding off: Characters inside the swarm who defend themselves by brandishing a weapon (or similar) suffer half damage from the swarm. A brandished torch damages the swarm.\tEscaping: On exiting the swarm, characters continue to suffer half damage until 3 rounds are spent swatting the attached insects.\tDiving into water: Suffer damage for one round, then attached insects drown.\tPursuit: An angry (i.e. damaged) swarm will pursue characters until they are out of sight or inaccessible."}
