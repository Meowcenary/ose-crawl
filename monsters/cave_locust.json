This may attract wandering monsters (20% chance per round).\tJump: Very skittish. If attacked, usually flee by jumping up to 60’ then flying away. 50% chance of jumping at a random opponent, in which case treat the jump as an attack.\tSpit: Used defensively. 10’ range. Target treated as AC 9 [10]. The affected character is covered in stinking spittle: unable to act for 1 turn (save versus poison). Until the goo is washed off, others who come within 5’ must also save versus poison or be violently sick.\tPoison immunity: Immune to yellow mould and most poisons, due to their habit of eating fungi."}
